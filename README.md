 Iot-smart-floating-city-grid
Designed an IoT-based system to monitor water levels in flood-prone areas using connected sensors. Applied real-time data analytics to predict risks and generate user alerts via dashboards and notifications. Proposed urban flooding mitigation use case for metropolitan cities such as Mumbai and Hyderabad.

 IoT Shamrock â€“ Smart City Floating Grid

 Overview
This project proposes an IoT-based smart infrastructure solution to tackle urban flooding in metro cities.  
The system integrates sensors, AI, and modular floating panels to ensure safe mobility during heavy rains.

Features
- Real-time monitoring using IoT water-level & pressure sensors.
- Automatic deployment of modular floating road panels for safe pathways.
- AI-controlled drainage gates to redirect water flow.
- Navigation app integration for rerouting traffic & emergency vehicles.
- Instant citizen alerts for safety and evacuation.

Tools & Methods
- Python (data simulation, predictive analytics)
- SQL (mock data storage/querying)
- Canva/PowerPoint (business model visualization)
- Shamrock Business Model (Users, Enterprises, Things, Partners)

 Outcome
- Real-time adaptation to floods beyond just warnings.
- Ensures mobility for emergency services and citizens.
- Demonstrates sustainable, scalable city infrastructure.
